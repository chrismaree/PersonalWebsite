    Cherry Swap is building next generation financial derivatives which leverage the existing DeFi ecosystem to offer pooled interest rate swaps for borrowers and lenders. Through interest rate swaps DeFi users can either secure a fixed rate to borrow or lend against or speculate on changing interest rates in the DeFi lending market. Cherry Swap implements a custom version of a traditional vanilla interest rate swap; hence the name interest rate swaps with a cherry on top.

    I am one of the co-founders of this project and am currently responsible for building out the financial models to build interest rate swaps within the DeFi space. Cherry Swap Won EthBerlin open track prize and has received the Binance X Fellowship.

    I was one of the founders of the project and helped build out the initial version for Christmas in 2018. Early 2019 we took the project to a new level integrating claimable links and DAI intergration for Chinese New Year 2019. I lead up the development for this second iteration and was responsible for the smart contracts and front end design and integration.

    MeterBlock was a collaborative project that created a decentralised platform to facilitate the governance of electrical energy consumption and production, measured and controlled by smart, blockchain-connected power meters. The goal of the project was to build a prototype device running on the Ethereum blockchain to facilitate this energy exchange governance.

    This project formed part of my dissertation for my honors degree. It won the [SAIEE National Student Paper Competition](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6471431887155011584/) as well as the most innovative 4th year project amongst all engineering discipline in my graduate class at Wits in 2018.
