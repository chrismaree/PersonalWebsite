  Hi ðŸ‘‹! I'm Chris and I am a full stack developer with interests in blockchain technology and decentralized finance. I've been involved in a bunch of different opensourced projects and startups, you can check them out below. 
    
  During my bachelors in electrical engineering I discovered blockchain and cryptocurrencies and was immediately sold on the potential they have to radically transform our society. When I started exploring the DeFi space I realized just how important it is to understand the fundamental economics and financial markets of the traditional world inorder to build a better decentralized financial system. To this end I'm currently doing my masters in financial technology which covers a wide range of relevant fields like blockchain, datascience, software engineering and financial markets topics.
 
  I see blockchain as a technology that empowers people for the first time to challenge the power structures that define our society at a protocol level.

  Oh and I also like scuba diving, photography, electronic music and good food ðŸ¤˜ðŸš€.
