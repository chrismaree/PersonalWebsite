    NFT eCards for greater fun and greater good. All income goes to charities working to promote Internet freedom and environmental rights. Under the hood RadiCards is a platform for creating NFT eCards. Ether or DAI can be attached to the eCards and then sent to friends using trustless claimable links.  All other proceeds go to charity.

    I was one of the founders of the project and helped build out the initial version for Christmas in 2018. Early 2019 we took the project to a new level integrating claimable links and dai for Chinese new year. I lead up the development for this second iteration and was responsible for the smart contracts and front end design and integration.

    MeterBlock was a collaborative project that created a decentralised platform to facilitate the governance of electrical energy consumption and production, measured and controlled by smart, blockchain-connected power meters. The goal of the project was to build a Proof-of-Concept (PoC) prototype device running on the Ethereum blockchain to facilitate this energy exchange energy governance.
