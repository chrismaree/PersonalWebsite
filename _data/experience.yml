   Registree is a decentralized and cryptographically secure student database and platform that connects students, universities and employers. Registree uses a combination of blockchain and distributed database technology so universities can securely store student data in a way that preserves students privacy and allows third parties to query student data. With Registree's platform, students own their data while universities are the sole creators of data which guarantees that the data obtained from the Registree platform is accurate, verified and authentic.
