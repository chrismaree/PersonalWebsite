  title: String-thingi
  description: A luminous tapestry of light and tension created for AfrikaBurn 2025. This installation uses 1.2km of UV reactive rope interwoven through a precision-crafted CNC wooden framework. During the day, it stands as a geometric marvel of tension and form—at night, it undergoes a complete metamorphosis as 200W of 365nm UV lights bring the invisible into brilliant existence. The intricacy of the <a href="https://a360.co/3XR0In6" target="_blank">CAD design</a> translates into an experiential space where mathematics becomes tactile, where rational design evokes irrational wonder. It's an exercise in precision becoming transcendence, in careful planning surrendering to spontaneous awe.

  title: Shadow Work
  description: Created for AfrikaBurn 2024's theme "Creation," this meditation on duality became my own form of shadow work—literal and metaphorical. Using CNC-cut wooden panels arranged in calculated patterns, the installation serves as both object and absence, presence and void. During daylight, the structure reveals one identity—solid, grounded, deliberate—while at night, it transforms completely, its shadows becoming the primary medium. This duality speaks to our own inner landscapes, how we present ourselves in different lights, how much remains unseen until conditions change. The careful interplay of positive and negative space reminds me how incomplete our self-perception often is, how much resides in our shadows, waiting to be illuminated when we change our perspective.

  title: Galactic Entryway
  description: Standing 3 meters tall in the middle of the dusty Tankwa desert, the Galactic Entryway created for AfrikaBurn 2023 marked a threshold between ordinary reality and something far more infinite. By day, it reflected the harsh desert light, offering fleeting glimpses of yourself—a practical mirror for dusty Burners to check their appearance. But as darkness fell, its 900W of UV lights powered by WLED controllers transformed the structure into a portal of boundless depth. The infinity mirror effect created a tunnel-like illusion that seemed to stretch beyond the physical constraints of our dimension. The juxtaposition delighted me—the same object could be both utterly practical and profoundly transcendent, just as we all contain multitudes of utilitarian function and cosmic possibility. Finding it unexpectedly in the darkness became a moment of wonder for many, a reminder that boundaries are more permeable than we think.

  title: Entering the Realm
  description: Built for Kiez Burn, Germany in 2023, "Entering the Realm" is an immersive exploration into Moloch's domain, examining the choices we face as humans between right and wrong, good and evil. Constructed within a 6-meter geodesic dome, this interactive audio and light experience presents participants with moral dilemmas of modern existence. Take nuclear power, for example—simultaneously a potential destroyer of worlds and a key to green energy. Similar arguments can be made for genetic engineering and other technological advances. Visitors walk through a circular gallery inside the dome, confronting these dualisms, before arriving at a central meditation area where they can reflect on their vision for humanity's future. The installation invites us to consider that our most challenging moral questions rarely have simple answers—that wisdom lies in navigating complexity rather than seeking absolutism.

  title: Duckeract
  description: The Duckeract, which debuted at AfrikaBurn 2022, emerged from that beautiful intersection of absurdity and intention. What began as a peculiar thought—"what if an infinity mirror was shaped like a duck and quacked when you approached it?"—evolved into a delightful contradiction of form. This anthropomorphized tesseract combined the innocuous charm of a rubber duck with the mind-bending properties of nested mirrors, creating an infinite regression of ducks-within-ducks that quacked loudly when its motion sensors detected nearby participants. It was serious craftsmanship in service of joyful silliness, technical execution for the sake of surprise and laughter. The project reminded me how play can be just as vital as purpose, how the most memorable experiences often come from ideas that initially sound ridiculous. In a world that often demands justification, sometimes "because it would be funny" is reason enough to create.

  title: Drone Photography
  description: Flying drones has become my meditation in motion—a way to embody that childhood dream of flight while developing an entirely new relationship with familiar landscapes. As I navigate South Africa's diverse terrain from above, I'm both physically grounded and perceptually soaring, experiencing a perspective shift that never fails to recalibrate my sense of scale and significance. The drone becomes an extension of curiosity, leading me to remote beaches at dawn, mountain peaks at sunset, and hidden valleys I might otherwise never explore. There's something fundamentally altering about witnessing the patterns that emerge from elevation—the rhythmic pulse of waves, the fractal geometry of riverbeds, the delicate tracery of paths through wilderness. These aerial journeys have become more than photography; they're excuses to encounter the world differently, to remember how many viewpoints exist beyond our everyday limitations, to experience the world as both vast and interconnected.
