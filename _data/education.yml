  description: |
    The BSC in Electrical Engineering is a 4 year honours level program. It contains a broad mix of courses that cover diverse aspects such as electric circuits, software engineering, microprocessors, telecommunications, electronics and networking. I tailored the program to focus on as much software engineering and computer science as possible, while still maintaining the electrical engineering topics. My honors year was focused heavily on blockchain based applications, where I created MeterBlock for my final year project.
