    UMA is a decentralized financial contracts platform built to enable Universal Market Access. Use UMAâ€™s self-enforcing contract design patterns and provably honest oracle mechanism to create your own financial products using standards like ERC20. Using concepts borrowed from fiat financial derivatives, UMA defines an open-source protocol that allows any two counterparties to design and create their own financial contracts. But unlike traditional derivatives, UMA contracts are secured with economic incentives alone, making them self-enforcing and universally accessible.
