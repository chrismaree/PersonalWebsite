  Hi ðŸ‘‹! I'm Chris and I am a full stack developer with interests in blockchain technology and decentralized finance. I've been involved in a bunch of different opensource projects and startups, you can check them out below. 
    
  I see blockchain as a technology that empowers people for the first time to challenge the power structures that define our society at a protocol level.

  Oh and I also like scuba diving, photography, live music and good food ðŸ¤˜ðŸš€.
