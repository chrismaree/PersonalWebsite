    HoneyLemon is creating synthetic Bitcoin cloud mining contracts on top of Ethereum. This enables BTC miners to sell the future payoff from their hash rate which acts as a hedge against volatility in the BTC mining industry. Investors can buy future payoff from cloud mining contracts to gain exposure to the synthetic payoff which. This enables them to get exposure to mining without needing to invest in mining equipment.

    Cherry Swap is building next generation financial derivatives which leverage the existing DeFi ecosystem to offer pooled interest rate swaps for borrowers and lenders. Through interest rate swaps DeFi users can either secure a fixed rate to borrow or lend against or speculate on changing interest rates in the DeFi lending market. Cherry Swap implements a custom version of a traditional vanilla interest rate swap; hence the name interest rate swaps with a cherry on top.

    MeterBlock was a collaborative project that created a decentralised platform to facilitate the governance of electrical energy consumption and production, measured and controlled by smart, blockchain-connected power meters. The goal of the project was to build a prototype device running on the Ethereum blockchain to facilitate this energy exchange governance.
