  Hi, I'm Chris â€” a crypto-native builder since 2016, working at the edge of technology, design, and decentralized systems. My work spans full-stack engineering, mechanism design, and experiments in cryptographic coordination.

  Currently exploring the intersection of finance, computer science, and economics, pursuing innovative ideas that could transform how we build and value digital assets.

  Beyond code, I create art installations, fly drones, explore ocean depths, and seek out live music and culinary adventures. Finding balance through creativity is essential to my process.
