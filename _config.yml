  Hi, I'm Chris and I am a full stack software developer with interests in blockchain technology and decentralized finance. I've been involved in a number of different projects and startups, you can check them out below. I originally studied electrical engineering and fell in love with crypto & blockchain in 2016. I'm currently doing my masters financial technology because I think that to be suspenseful in the decentralized(open) finance movement one needed an understanding of the fundamental economics to have a maximum long term impact.
  
  I'm currently the CIO of [links](http://foobar.com)
