  description: |
    UpsideDai is a highly leveraged contract for difference (CFD) built on Dai, Uniswap and Maker. This mechanism enables traders and speculators to bet on and hedge against price fluctuations of Dai by buying leveraged long or short positions. The CFD construction enables high leverage (20x) while remaining capital efficient and not requiring high margin requirements (100% collateralization). Positions are priced against the market observable Dai/Usd price by using a combination of the Maker oracle and Uniswap.

  github: DaddyDeFi/DaiDaddy
  description: |
    DAI Daddy II builds on enabling the unwinding CDPs. Under this model, rather than requiring a counterparty to ensure a CDP is repaid, the new DAI Daddy smart contract withdraws collateral from the CDP, uses Kyber Network to convert this ETH to DAI, and then pays off the CDP and returns the remaining ETH collateral to the owner.

  description: |
    Dai Daddy is an autonomous platform for buying and selling Maker CDPs. Sellers can list their CDP for sale and offer a "discount rate" - less than the 13% fee they would have to pay if forcibly liquidated - which incentivises buyers to provide capital upfront and buy out the seller's debt. In this way it acts like a debt market for makerCDPs.

    Dapp to sell crypto at predefined intervals on the way up during a bull run. Dapp calculates all sell prices based on user input and recommends the best strategy to exit your position. Funds are stored in smart contracts and automatically traded via Uniswap. Contracts were written in `Vyper`, front end in `VueJS` using `materialUI`. Offchain relayers watch the contracts and trustlessly execute trade orders within the contract to preform token swaps on `UniSwap`.

    Dapp created as past of masters degree enabling academics to monetize their research for commercial applications while supporting open science. Researches can register on the platform, upload their works and create open auctions for material. Companies can buy licenses to use the research which mints non-fungible tokens(`ERC721`) which represent ownership of a licence. Integration done with `IPFS` for file storage and `Orcid` for academic profile verification.

  description: |
    Cryptocurrency backtest to compare different rebalancing and trading strategies. It covers working with crypto price API's to retrieve information, manipulate this information using `pandas` and `numpy` into something that can be used in time series computations to implement different trading strategies. Interactive time series plotting is covered using `plotly`.

  description: |
    I wrote a paper on the current research into Ethereum smart contract development best practice relating to contract security. Previously hacked contracts are identified and discussed, breaking down exactly how the hack occured. A selection of the latest symbolic execution-based and static analysis tools are then used to analyze these contracts to try and identify the exploited vulnerabilities.
